</div>

Above shows the window that will greet you upon opening Strain++. There is not much here yet so you should open an image. This can be done through the ```File``` menu or through the shortcut ```Ctrl+O```. The supported file types are .dm3, .dm4 or .tif (non-RGB).

<div class="image-figure">
    <img style="width:70%;" src="{{'/assets/images/2_images.png' | relative_url}}" alt="Strain++ interface" />
    <p>
        <span class="figure-title">Figure</span> After opening a file, the image is dispayed on the left and the FFT on the right.
    </p>
</div>

Now you can see your image and its Fourier transform (FFT). Select the <code>Strain &rarr; GPA</code> menu to start measuring the strain in your image.

<div class="image-figure">
    <img style="width:70%;" src="{{'/assets/images/3_gvector.png' | relative_url}}" alt="Strain++ interface" />
    <p>
        <span class="figure-title">Figure</span> Dialog to select mask mask size.
    </p>
</div>

Strain++ now needs to know what mask size to use when masking off individual g-vectors. Here the dotted line is Strain++â€™s estimation of the smallest g-vector and the solid line is the mask size. If you do not like the calculated mask size, you can enter in a size manually or by choosing the smallest lattice vector on the FFT. Once you are happy, click yes to accept the mask size.

    <p>
        <span class="figure-title">Figure</span> Dialog to refine the g-vector.
    </p>
</div>

You now need to click on the first g-vector you want to use in the analysis. The corresponding phase image will be shown in place of the image. If you want to refine the g-vector, select yes.

    <img style="width:70%;" src="{{'/assets/images/5_refine.png' | relative_url}}" alt="Strain++ interface" />
    <p>
        <span class="figure-title">Figure</span> Selecting an area to refine the phase with.
    </p>
</div>

You need to select an area to refine from, click twice to define the two corners of the refinement area.

<div class="image-figure">
    <img style="width:70%;" src="{{'/assets/images/6_refined.png' | relative_url}}" alt="Strain++ interface" />
    <p>
        <span class="figure-title">Figure</span> Dialog confirming refinement.
    </p>
</div>

You now have the option to refine again or continue to the next g-vector. The process for the second g-vector is exactly the same as the first.

<div class="image-figure">
    <img style="width:70%;" src="{{'/assets/images/7_strain.png' | relative_url}}" alt="Strain++ interface" />
    <p>
        <span class="figure-title">Figure</span> Output distortions.
    </p>
</div>

You will now be shown the output of the GPA. Here you can choose the exact output, basis rotation or select the colours. On the ```Other``` tab the intermediate steps can be displayed. Right clicking on an image will give options for exporting it, or data can be exported en masse from the ```File``` menu.
